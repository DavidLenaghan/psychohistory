A project for generating the future

The initial idea is this.....

Everything that happens in the future is due to random interactions between objects in the present.
Unfortunately it is not possible to measure everything in the present.

Forecasting techniques currently rely on predicting the behaviour of those things that were measured in the present and past and using this information to extrapolate their future behaviour. This only works to an extent because of the errors in initial measurement and the effect of those things that were not measured.

There is another approach which relies on a computer's ability to generate millions of random numbers.

This project will be an exploration of these possibilities using the R statistical framework.

Watch this space with one eye. (Watch the future with the other.)
